    <h1>To my forever</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I know it's incredibly childish of me to create a webpage on this subject, but I'm doing it today because I truly
        wanted to express my love for you.</p>
    <p>U might be thinking, I could have said u these things on chat, But i didn't said as there were numerous reasons.
        <br>1) Brief explanation
        <br>2) More things to say
        <br>3) We talk very less ig nd u rarely message me

    <h2>Shayari for U</h2>
    <hr> Ham To Aapse Bepahannah Payar Karte Hai,
    <br>Ye Wo Gunah Hai Jo Ham Bar Bar Karte Hai,
    <br>Dil Se Khawahise Ki Chirag Jalakar,
    <br>Ham Subho Sham Tere Milne Ka Intezaar Karte Hai.
    <br><br>

    <hr>Tu Yad Kre Ya Na kre Meri Khusi,
    <br>Ham To Tumhe Yad Karte Rahte Hai,
    <br>Tujhe Dekhne Ko Dil Tarsta Hai,
    <br>Ham To Intezaar Karte Rahte Hai.
    <h2>My Expression</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Dear -------,
        <br>This paragraph is written with immense desperation and severe urgency. These are my words and u won't find
        it anywhere on Internet. Well it is on internet btw for now :):)
        <br>Well to start with a cheesy line, I would say
        <br>---- I need your help and in this entire universe u r the one who could easily help me with this.I have lost
        something very important, I lost my heart to you. Could you please help me find it.
        <br><br>The first time I laid eyes on you, I knew I had strong feelings for you.
         Your aura was captivating and when we used to sit together, everything felt right.
          Before I knew it, you were gone and I was left feeling confused and hurt. 
          Despite how much it pained me, my love for you never faded – it only got stronger with each passing day. 
          We talked and you explained your reasoning, but it was still perplexing. 
          You said my words would lead you to love me, but you didn't want that and it never happened. 
          You said you wanted to be in a relationship but only with your parents' permission – something I know for sure won't happen.
           You have the choice to be with someone you feel comfortable with, and in the end, it doesn't really matter if we are in a relationship or not. 
           To me, it's more about having a strong connection that goes beyond labels.
        I just want us to have a bond that's unique and special.
        <br>
    <h2>The end</h2>
    <hr> I took the same class as you since it's me who wants to see and talk to you every day. I'm not sure where our
    relationship will go, but I think it'll be because I wasn't able to explain myself adequately this time.
    <br>You'd find out one day when I go, but don't worry, I'll always be there for you, even if you murder someone
    (this is a hypothetical situation, of course).
    <br> I think it would be better if i leave your way. I have distureb you a lot these days. I know i am disturbing,
    that'swhy i don't want to drag u into this. I would be alone but atleast i could say out loud there was someone in
    college i loved and i guessed would be a part of me but atlast not everbody does have a good ending.

    <h3>
        The graph of these equations would say what I wanted to say to you.
    </h3>
    Y=1/x,
    <br>x2 +y2 =9

    <br>y= |-2x|,

    <br>x= -3|sin y|

    <h4>


        143 is the number I would always say to you, and I ask you, "Will you spend your 60 years with me?" I promise I
        won't give you a chance to complain. We would fight, but everything would be fine in the end.


    </h4>
    I hope this website to make a strong bond between us.
    <br>And, sure, this website is still under construction, and work is being done. So wait for final results.
